## 1. Introduction

This README provides an overview of a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) project aimed at automating the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) process for web applications. UAT is a critical step in the software development lifecycle (which is similar to the automation developement lifecycle), ensuring that input data produces the expected output. The RPA solution discussed here automates the repetitive task of performing UAT for web applications, thus saving time and improving efficiency.

## 2. Overview

In the world of software development, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a pivotal phase. It serves as a 'go/no-go' decision point before a solution is deployed into production. During UAT, testers evaluate the solution's performance by inputting data and validating the output. Traditionally, UAT is a manual process, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and repetitive. This project aims to leverage RPA to automate UAT for web applications, specifically focusing on testing the creation of new records.

## 3. Purpose

The purpose of this RPA project is to:

- Streamline the UAT process for web applications by automating the repetitive testing tasks.
- Improve efficiency by minimizing human intervention in UAT.
- Ensure that the input data generates the expected output consistently.
- Expedite the decision-making process by providing accurate test results.

## 4. Requirements

Before implementing this RPA solution, ensure you have the following pre-requisites in place:

- Link to web application hosted on Azure (provided above).
- RPA software and tools (UiPath Studio) installed.
- Test data, including input data records and the expected output data (provided).
- An Internet connection

## 5. Process

In order to see the automation in action, simply click the link provided above. This is an automation project, everything will happen until the very end.

## 6. Solution

The RPA solution in this project will focus on automating the UAT for the web application by:

- Automating the input of test data records into the web application's fields.
- Data will be created and entered into the database, edited and then finally deleted from the database in order to test the CRUD Functionalities.
- Validating that the expected output data is generated.
- Providing accurate and consistent results, reducing the margin of error.

## 7. Testing

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure that the RPA solution performs UAT accurately. Testers must verify that:

- The RPA solution correctly reads and inputs test data.
- The expected output matches the actual output generated by the web application.
- The solution handles any exceptions or errors gracefully.

## 8. Deployment

The RPA solution successfully passed all testing and has been deployed online via the Orchestrator.

## 9. Conclusion

This RPA project aims to significantly enhance the efficiency of the UAT process for web applications. It also strives to test and enhance the CRUD functionalities of the website. By automating repetitive tasks, it reduces the likelihood of human errors and speeds up the decision-making process. Implementing this solution will lead to more reliable UAT results and, ultimately, a more efficient software development lifecycle.
